#THREAT INTELLIGENCE DASHBOARD 
######################################################

The aim behind a good threat intelligence dashboard is one designed to promote good decision making to the upper management by offering actionable insights. 
This dashboard was designed to display cyber threat data in a user-friendly, graphical format, providing the ability to view overall trends and dig more deeply 
into items that require closer scrutiny. This dashboard design has information readily available—for the team and stakeholders to view and understand the following:
-	The nature of cyber threats (malware families, tactics, techniques, and procedures)
-	The urgency behind each threat (severity)
-	The key indicators of compromise for threat hunters (indicators)
-	Target sectors…and much more.
